## how to run
if you want to run the application with docker all you need to do is fill out the env.tempalte file, you will need a account in imgure and make a application to upload the images.

if you want to run the application with kubernetes then you will need to fill out the configmap-tempalte do the same with imgur from before and then run the folder kubernetes_mikkel, when that have run if it is your first time you will need to run kubernetes-manual after to run the seeder, som of the pods might start up to fast so it is recomneded to reload handlers and sync-worker
